Official Website: [mvc-php.com](http://mvc-php.com)

## What is this repository about?
There are many other MVC PHP frameworks on the internet. However, to find a absolutely suitable for you is not easy. Why don't you build you own framework?
With that question in my mind, I build this framework and will help you build your own framework.
I provide full tutorial how to build a new framework the same to this. Since then, you can understand your framework well, customize it easily, have better knowledge on PHP and OOP. 

## How to use it
* **The master branch includes the basic core of the framework.
* **For each tutorial, I will seperate it into a branch (tut-01, tut-02, etc.)
